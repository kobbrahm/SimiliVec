## Project Overview

**SimiliVec** is a custom vector database designed to explore the mechanics of high-performance similarity search. The project focuses on a native C# implementation of modern vector database components:

* **Embedding Model:** Uses the **E5 transformer model** for generating high-quality vector representations.
* **Indexing Structure:** Implements the **Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)** graph for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search.

---

## Key Features (Planned)

*  High-performance **HNSW** index implementation.
*  Native integration with the **E5** embedding model.
*  Simple API for vector insertion and similarity search.
